# YAML

YAML is not markup language 

Human-friendly data serialization standard

Data Serialization: This is the process of converting data into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, and reconstructed later. YAML does this for data structures like lists, dictionaries, and more.

Human-friendly: YAML was designed to be easy to read and write for humans, with minimal syntax and formatting overhead. It looks more like regular text than complex code.
